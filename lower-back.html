  <p>Great! I'll find online resources that explain each muscle group’s role in lower back issues, how to assess weaknesses or tightness, and effective corrective exercises. I'll gather scientific articles, physiotherapy resources, and video tutorials to support your understanding. I'll share the results with you soon.</p>

          Weak deep core muscles reduce spinal stability, forcing superficial muscles and the lumbar spine to overwork. This compensation increases load on the spine, contributing to lower back pain

A weak core often causes the lower back to <strong>overextend</strong> on foot strike. Uphill running still requires core engagement to maintain posture, so core weakness can lead to faster back fatigue.

          <strong>Side Plank Test</strong> – Lie on your side supported by one forearm and feet, keeping your spine straight. Hold as long as possible. Inability to hold ~60 seconds (or a >5% time difference between sides) indicates core weakness or imbalance

        </td>
        <td>
          The glutes stabilize the pelvis and extend the hip. Weak or inactive glutes (especially glute medius) cause pelvic drop and excessive trunk side-bending, leading to strain on the lumbar spine

If the glutes don’t carry their load, the lower back and hamstrings compensate, contributing to fatigue and pain. Tight glutes can also tilt the pelvis and stress the low back

          <strong>Single-Leg Bridge Test</strong> – Lie on your back, lift hips into a bridge with one foot on the floor and the other leg extended. Inability to keep the hips up (pelvis dropping) or feeling the hamstring cramp on the supporting side indicates glute weakness/dominance issues

A positive Trendelenburg sign (hip drops when standing on one leg) also signals weak glute medius.

        <td>
          <strong>Glute Strengthening &amp; Activation</strong> – <em>Clamshells, Glute Bridges, Lateral Band Walks/Sidesteps</em>, and even side planks all target the gluteus medius and maximus

These exercises improve pelvic stability. Emphasize squeezing the glutes during hip extension movements. For tight glutes, incorporate stretching (figure-4 piriformis stretch) and foam rolling to restore flexibility.

          Tight hip flexors (often from prolonged sitting) pull the pelvis into an anterior tilt and increase the arch in the lower back

This posture is exaggerated when running upright, and especially uphill (which requires more hip flexion). The result is more stress on the lumbar facets and quicker fatigue of lower back muscles. Weak or fatigued hip flexors can also alter running form, but <strong>tightness</strong> is a more common contributor to lower back issues

          <strong>Thomas Test (Self-check)</strong> – Sit at the edge of a sturdy table and lie back hugging one knee to your chest. Let the other leg hang down. If the hanging thigh can’t drop parallel to the floor (hip remains flexed), your iliopsoas is tight; if the knee of that leg can’t bend ~90°, the rectus femoris (quadriceps) is tight

          <strong>Hip Flexor Stretches &amp; Mobility</strong> – Regularly perform a <em>Half-Kneeling Hip Flexor Stretch</em> (kneel on one knee, tuck the pelvis under/posterior tilt, and shift forward) to lengthen the iliopsoas

Other PT-recommended stretches include lunging hip flexor stretches, dynamic leg swings, and the prone "runner’s stretch". Strengthening the glutes and core will also alleviate overreliance on hip flexors

          The hamstrings assist the glutes in propelling uphill. Uphill running forces the hamstrings (and glutes) to work in a shortened range, so they <strong>fatigue quickly</strong>

          <strong>Hamstring Flexibility Test</strong> – A simple gauge is the classic <em>Sit-and-Reach Test</em>, which measures hamstring and lower-back flexibility

From a seated position with legs straight, reaching short of your feet or feeling intense stretch behind the thighs indicates tight hamstrings. An Active Straight Leg Raise (<80° hip flexion before the knee bends) also signifies reduced hamstring length

          <strong>Hamstring Stretches &amp; Strength</strong> – Gentle <em>hamstring stretches</em> (standing toe-touch stretch, seated forward bend, lying towel stretch, etc.) done regularly will gradually lengthen the muscles and <strong>reduce stress on the lower back</strong>

For example, a standing hamstring stretch or a doorway stretch can improve flexibility. Ensure proper form (hinge at the hips, not the lower back). In addition, eccentric strengthening (e.g. Nordic hamstring curls or slow RDLs) can bolster hamstring endurance for uphill running, so they don’t fatigue as easily. Maintaining hamstring flexibility and strength helps keep the pelvis neutral and unloads the lumbar spine.
